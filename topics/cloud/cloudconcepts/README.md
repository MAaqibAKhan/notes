# Cloud concepts

In this module you will learn about the concepts of cloud. These concepts are shared among all the cloud providers.

## What is the cloud

The terms ‘cloud computing’ and ‘the cloud’ have been used to describe all kinds of different technology. Are we
talking about Distributed computing? Networked Services? Virtualised Servers or Hosted services? The actual
definition of cloud computing as reported by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is: "Cloud computing 
is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing 
resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released 
with minimal management effort or service provider interaction"
