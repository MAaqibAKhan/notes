# Cloud enabling technologies

In this module you will learn what technologies allow cloud services to work.

## Fast wide area networks

In order to get the location-independence of the cloud, you need a fast wide-area network. Otherwise the users and the 
servers all need to be physically close, or connected by a dedicated network.

With a fast, wide-area network, we can support users in many different locations, and we can support high-availability 
and disaster recovery solutions that would previously have been unworkable.
