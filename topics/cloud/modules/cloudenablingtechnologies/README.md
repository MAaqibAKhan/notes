# Cloud enabling technologies

In this module you will learn what technologies allow cloud services to work.

## Fast wide area networks

In order to get the location-independence of the cloud, you need a fast wide-area network. Otherwise the users and the 
servers all need to be physically close, or connected by a dedicated network.

With a fast, wide-area network, we can support users in many different locations, and we can support high-availability 
and disaster recovery solutions that would previously have been unworkable.

## Powerful, inexpensive server computers

In order to get the pool of interchangeable resources required by a cloud, we need to be able to buy lots of servers 
and configurable them, and they need to be reasonably powerful.

Building a data centre is a specialist skill, and there are standards and bodies of knowledge related to it.

Data centres are becoming increasingly efficient and cheap, to the extent that it is possible to get a containerised 
`modular data centre` shipped to you.

When choosing a cloud provider, they will probably be able to document the standards
to which their data centre adheres.

TIA-942 and Uptime Institute are the two best-known examples.
