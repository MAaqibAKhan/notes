# Cloud benefits

In this module you will learn about what benefits Cloud technologies offer.

## Scaling in/out

Scaling in and out is a reference to your services automatically reacting to the amount of work they need to do and if 
the resources available are not enough to automatically get more, once the workload decreases the resources are 
released as well.

* Scale Out
    * Cope with spikes in demand (expected and unexpected)
    * Scale out from zero, for batch processing
* Scale in
    * In response to lower demand
    * Automatically based on time of day (peak hours)
    * Lower costs
In the picture below we can see how there is always just a bit more computational power than the demand requires. Also 
based on the amount of users coming to the service there is an increase in the resources required, once the peak time is
 over then the resources are released.
